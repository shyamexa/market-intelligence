# Market Intelligence Bot

## Overview

The Market Intelligence Bot is a specialized RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system built for financial firms and competitive intelligence teams. It leverages Exa's advanced search capabilities combined with OpenAI's language models to deliver high-quality, source-backed market insights.

## Key Features for Financial Intelligence

### üéØ Highlights-Based Extraction

Unlike traditional web scraping, this system uses Exa's **highlights** feature to extract the most relevant sentences from web pages. This approach is particularly valuable for financial research because:

- **Precision**: Gets exactly the information needed without noise
- **Context**: Maintains semantic relevance to your query
- **Efficiency**: No need to process entire articles manually

### üìè Customizable Content Length

The `num_sentences` parameter allows precise control over highlight length:

```python
highlights_options = {
    "num_sentences": 2,        # Perfect for executive summaries
    "highlights_per_url": 2    # Multiple insights per source
}
```

**Financial Use Cases:**

- **Earnings Analysis**: 1-2 sentences for key metrics
- **Market Trends**: 3-4 sentences for comprehensive context
- **Regulatory Updates**: Variable length based on complexity

### üè¶ Domain Filtering for Trusted Sources

Critical for financial compliance and accuracy:

```python
include_domains = [
    "bloomberg.com", "reuters.com", "wsj.com", 
    "forbes.com", "ft.com", "cnbc.com",
    "sec.gov", "federalreserve.gov"
]
```

**Why This Matters:**

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensures sources meet institutional standards
- **Data Quality**: Financial-grade information from trusted publishers
- **Risk Management**: Reduces exposure to unreliable sources

## Architecture

### Core Components

```python
class MarketIntelligenceBot:
    def __init__(self, company_name, industry, competitors):
        self.exa = Exa(api_key=EXA_API_KEY)
        self.openai = OpenAI(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
```

### Search Configuration

```python
def search_market_intelligence(self, questions, timeframe="1M"):
    search_options = {
        "num_sentences": 2,
        "highlights_per_url": 2,
    }
    
    # Date filtering for recency
    start_date = (datetime.now() - timedelta(days=30)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    
    search_response = exa.search_and_contents(
        question, 
        highlights=search_options, 
        num_results=5,
        start_published_date=start_date,
        include_domains=trusted_financial_domains
    )
```
